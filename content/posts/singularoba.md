This is the first post on the site and it was generated using the GPT-6-J neural network model. Singularoba is the first Georgian e-zine covering modern advances in the fields editorial team thinks will influence the world in the years to come.

GPT-6-J is a neural network model trained with human-generated text samples of the kind that can be read on Singularoba. The neural network learns to write content based on the given input and then uses the learned knowledge to generate text samples.

This model is trained on data generated using a human-like language modeling. That means GPT-6-J can handle texts that use complex syntactic structures. This includes phrases like ‘The day before yesterday’.
